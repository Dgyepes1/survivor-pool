        <li><a href = "{{ request.route_url('select') }}">Select your team</a> - Every week participants select a team to win a single NFL game.
            <ul><li>All picks must be in by Thursday 5:00pm Eastern</ul>
        <li>Participants are eliminated if their selected team losses.
            <ul><li><a href = "{{ request.route_url('pool') }}">See who is left in the pool.</a></ul>
        <li>Survivors cannot select the team twice.
