    There will be a selector here for a given week.  This will make a query for that week to the db which then populates the template below.
    Will default to the current week, or the first week if pre-season.
    <ul>
        {{% for event in events %}}
            <li>
                <ul>
                {{ datetime }}
                    <li data-value="home">{{ home }}</li>
                    <li data-value="away">{{ away }}</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
